# Curator #

by [Quentin Hill][1]


## Important Note ##

This is extremely early alpha-quality work. You have been warned.


## Description ##

Curator is a static website builder written in [PHP][2].

Keep it simple.

Content is written in a combination of [YAML][3] and [Markdown][4]. Templates are created with [[INSERT\_TEMPLATE\_ENGINE\_HERE]]. Styles and scripts are crafted in their native languages, then automatically joined and minified into a single files. Curator gathers these files, and any other needed information, and builds a static website ready to deploy anywhere.

## Inspiration ##

Curator is not the best solution out there. Seriously. This is just some random side project of mine. I can’t guarantee much of any kind of support for Curator. It’s me, not you.

Do feel free to use Curator, if you wish. I would be honored. But for now, I would have to recommend one of these many fine alternatives:

* [Phrozn][9]: Right about the time I decided to get serious with this project, Phrozn came out. And that’s the story of how this project was almost killed.
* [CakePHP][10]: Real men use full featured MVC frameworks. Anything else might as well grab a corked fork, and head over to the kids table.
* [camen design][11]: The biggest inspiration behind all of this. I clicked with his ideas, and figured I could take them to needless extremes.
* [Any other framework][12].
