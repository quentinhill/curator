## Inspiration ##

Curator is nothing new. There is a large selection of site generators out there.

Curator was created as a solution to maintaining my personal website. It is unleashed unto the world under the [MIT license][mit-license].

Want to shop around a little more? Check out the following:

* [Phrozn][phrozn]: Right about the time I decided to get serious with this project, Phrozn came out. And thatâ€™s the story of how this project was almost killed.
* [CakePHP][cakephp]: Real men use full featured MVC frameworks. Anything else might as well grab a corked fork, and head over to the kids table.
* [camen design][camendesign]: The biggest inspiration behind all of this. I clicked with his ideas, and figured I could take them to needless extremes.
